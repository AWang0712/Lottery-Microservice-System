 * - Application services are located at the application layer. They are used to represent application and user behavior,
 * are responsible for the combination, orchestration and forwarding of services,
 * and are responsible for handling the order of execution of business use cases and the collocation of results.
 * -  Services at the application layer include application services and domain event related services.
 * - Domain event services include two categories: publication and subscription of domain events.
 * Asynchronous data transfer is achieved through event buses and message queues to realize decoupling between microservices.
